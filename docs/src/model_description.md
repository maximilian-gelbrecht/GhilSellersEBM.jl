The model and its implementation is based on the following papers: 

* [Sellers: "A Global Climatic Model Based on the Energy Balance of the Earth-Atmosphere System", 1969](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/8/3/1520-0450_1969_008_0392_agcmbo_2_0_co_2.xml)
* [Ghil: "Climate Stability for a Sellers-Type Model", 1976](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/33/1/1520-0469_1976_033_0003_csfast_2_0_co_2.xml)
* [Bodai et al: "Global instability in the Ghil-Sellers model", 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3269)
    
What follows is a step by step introduction to the implementation:
